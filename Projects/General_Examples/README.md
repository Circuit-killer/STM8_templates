General Examples
=================

This folder contains some general, board independent examples for
the STM8 template library. The functionality (loosely sorted by 
rising complexity) is as follows:

Minimal-C: 
----------
  simple C-project without Arduino-like initialization and 
  setup()/loop(). No assumption is made, no interrupts used.
  Can be used as starting point for projects with extreme
  memory limitations.
  Functionality:
  - init FCPU to 16MHz
  - configure pin as output
  - toggle pin every 500ms with delay (->blocking)
  - optionally use delay via SW (less overhead & latency) or timer 3 (robust against high ISR load)


Minimal-C_with_ISR
----------
  simple C-project without Arduino-like initialization and 
  setup()/loop(), but with interrupt.
  Functionality (see "portme.c"):
  - init FCPU to 16MHz
  - configure pin as output
  - init 1ms TIM4 interrupt (for measuring times)
  - toggle pin every 500ms based on SW clock (->non-blocking)
  Note:
  - SDCC requires ISRs declared in source containing main()


Basic_Project: 
----------
  Arduino-like project with setup() & loop(). Only 1ms interrupts
  are used, but no other optional features. Can be used as a 
  starting point for simple Arduino-like STM8 projects.
  Functionality:
  - configure pin as output
  - poll SW clock and toggle pin every 500ms -> non-blocking


Timeout_Scheduler:
----------

  to execute periodic tasks in loop().

----------
  Arduino-like project with setup() & loop(). Dynamically attach 
  user functions to 1ms interrupt (-> #define USE_MILLI_ISR) to 
  automatically call function every 1ms. 
  Functionality:
  - configure 2 pins as output high
  - attach pin toggle function to 1ms interrupt -> background operation
  - use timeouts to periodically perform tasks in ISR

  - run benchmark test and print result
  Note:
  - SDCC requires ISRs declared in source containing main(), here "dhry_1.c"
